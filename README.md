# hello-world
just another repository
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
These changes will be made to just the README file on your readme-edits branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from main.
